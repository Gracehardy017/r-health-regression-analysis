# r-health-regression-analysis
Linear and logistic regression analysis in R using example health data sets, with description of model outputs and limitations.

## Overview
Aim of the project is to identify and interpret key predictors, describe model assumptions and limitations. Using publicly available health-related data sets, both linear and logistic regression will be applied using R. 

## Objectives
- Model healthcare costs using linear regression methods
- Model disease risk using logistic regression methods
- Interpret coefficients, odds ratios, and statistical significance
- Assess and describe model assumptions and limitations

## Datasets
- **Medical Insurance Cost Dataset** – used for linear regression
- **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** – used for logistic regression

## Methods
- Exploratory data analysis
- Model fitting and diagnostics
- Interpretation of results
- Discussion of limitations

## Key Outputs
- Reproducible RMarkdown analyses
- Model diagnostics and visualisations
- Written interpretation of results
